    documentation="Improving government services in the Digital Age&#xD;&#xA;Our goal is to provide public services to Canadians which are simple to use and trustworthy. The Government of Canada’s Digital Standards form the foundation of the government’s shift to becoming more agile, open, and user-focused. They will guide teams in designing digital services in a way that best serves Canadians.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;These digital standards were co-created with the public and key stakeholder groups. They are living standards and they will continue to evolve over time as we better understand the complexities involved in putting them into practice.&#xD;&#xA;https://www.canada.ca/en/government/publicservice/modernizing/government-canada-digital-standards.html"/>
